## Introduction
The **Human Pose Estimation App** is built to estimate key points of a human body from uploaded images, videos, or real-time webcam streams. This application uses the **MediaPipe** framework for pose detection and renders the pose skeleton with connection lines and landmarks in images or video frames.

---

## Features
- Upload images and videos for pose estimation.  
- Use your webcam for real-time pose detection.  
- Interactive user interface powered by Streamlit.  
- Detailed visual representation of poses with key point detection.
